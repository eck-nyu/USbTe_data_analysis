# USbTe_data_analysis
## Load, open, analyze ARPES data taken at the BNL.4.0.3 beamline at Advanced Light Source at Berkeley National Lab during Dec 2021 experiment

## Main functions: 
#### gap_Map.m 
##### Load some live-polar scans of intensity-vs-thetax-vs-polar and evaluate energy gap throughout all 2d k-space 

#### open_Tdep_set_.m
##### Open temperature scans of intensity-vs-thetax-vs-temperature to see spectral changes as temperature is varied

#### hv2kz_.m
##### Open a photon-energy scan as a temperature scan, then run this to convert to kz space and approximate the inner potential
